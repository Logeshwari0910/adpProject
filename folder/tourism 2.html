<hl><b><font color=red>HISTORY OF OOTY</font></b></hl>
<p><ul><i>Like any other place in India, Ooty is rich in history, though a lot of it is lost in transition and still very little is actually recorded in government files. To actually speak the truth, when a place is so full of scenic beauty and cultural heritage, a majority of the tourists are not actually too keen to know the history of the place. But if go digging deep into the vaults, the History of Ooty is quite fascinating and bound to throw a surprise or two.

     The Ooty we see today is quite the anti thesis of what it used to be, say, half a century ago. In fact, all the development activities that you see around, once you reach the main town were not initiated until quite recently. When you talk about the history of Ooty, not much is known apart from what was recorded by the English when they ruled India.</i></ul></p>
