But if go digging deep into the vaults, the History of Ooty is quite fascinating and bound to throw a surprise or two.

     The Ooty we see today is quite the anti thesis of what it used to be, say, half a century ago. In fact, all the development activities that you see around, once you reach the main town were not initiated until quite recently. When you talk about the history of Ooty, not much is known apart from what was recorded by the English when they ruled India.</i></ul></p>

Throughout that time, a number of clubs, cottages, and other buildings were built that offered entertainment and recreational facilities to the British officials. Rail connection was laid to reach Ooty during 1880. Gradually, this hill town became the place for the growing of tea leaves, thus, came up several tea estates. After independence, the Government of India, started promoting Ooty as a tourist destination.</i></li></P>
