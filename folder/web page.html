<h1>AMERICAN COMPAN1>
<ul>Google is an American search engine company, founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Since 2015, Google has been a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet, Inc. More than 70% of worldwide online search requests are handled by Google, placing it at the heart of most Internet users’ experience. It is one of the world’s most prominent brands </ul>

<ul>Other services</ul>
 <ul> Google’s expansion, fueled largely by keyword-based Web advertising, provided it with a sound footing to compete in new Web services. Some were meant to broaden the company’s reach across the technology spectrum, but others, such as Google Maps and YouTube, would enhance Google’s search engine dominance by integrating the search experience with other user data, including geolocation, web browsing, and media usage.</ul>

<h3>Gmail</h3>
<ul>Google later expanded the amount of free storage space given to users to seven gigabytes and allowed users to rent additional space. In 2007 the company acquired Postini, an e-mail services firm, for $625 million in order to improve Gmail’s security, especially in Google’s efforts to sign up businesses. In 2009 Google removed the beta status of Gmail, increasing its appeal to business users.</ul>

<h5>GOOGLE EARTH AND GOOGLE MAP</h5
 <UL>Google Earth is a mapping service that renders detailed 3D images of various locations on the planet. In 2004 Google bought Keyhole, Inc., which was partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. Keyhole had developed an online mapping service that Google rebranded in 2005 as Google Earth. This service let users find detailed satellite images of most locations on Earth and also create combinations (known as “mashups”) with various other databases, incorporating details such as street names, weather patterns, crime statistics, coffee shop locations, real-estate prices, and population densities into maps created by Google Earth.</UL>

 <h6>GOOGLE VIDEO AND YOUTUBE</h6>
 <UL>In January 2005 Google launched Google Video, which enabled individuals to search the close-captioned text from television broadcasts. A few months later Google began accepting user-submitted videos, with submitters setting the prices for others to download and view the videos. In January 2006 Google Video Store opened, featuring premium content from traditional media companies such as CBS Corporation (television shows) and Sony Corporation (movies). In June 2006 Google began offering premium content for free but with ads.</UL>

 <h7>ANDROID OS AND ENTRY INTO THE SMARTPHONE MARKET</h7>
<ul>Google was obliged to battle competitors over Android in the courts as well as in the marketplace. In 2010, for example, Oracle Corporation sued Google for $6.1 billion in damages, claiming Android had violated numerous patents relating to Oracle’s Java programming language. (After two years in court, Google eventually won the lawsuit.) Instead of attacking Google directly, Apple sued makers of Android smartphones, such as HTC, Motorola Mobility, and Samsung, over alleged patent violations. Apple CEO Steve Jobs was said to have claimed, “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.” The patent wars over mobile operating systems seemed unresolvable, as suits and countersuits were filed with each release of a new version. But, as of 2023, Android held a 70.8% market share among smartphones, with Apple holding the second spot at 28.4%.</ul>

<h8>REFERENCE</h8>
<ul>Ken Auletta, Googled: The End of the World as We Know It (2009), is an insightful look at how Google radically changed the media landscape. It includes an astute analysis of how “old media” such as newspapers and magazines were slow to react to people’s using the Internet for information gathering and how Google lured old media advertisers to its business. The book is slightly critical of the engineering bias and technology focus of its managers. Steven Levy, In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives (2011), is a sympathetic look at how the company’s technology-driven yet customer-focused business model conquered the Internet advertising market.</ul>
