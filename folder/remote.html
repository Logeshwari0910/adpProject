 <h1>REMOTE</h1>
 <p><pre>Wired and wireless remote control was developed in the latter half of the 19th century to meet the need to 
    control unmanned vehicles (for the most part military torpedoes).[5] These included a wired version by German engineer
     Werner von Siemens in 1870, and radio controlled ones by British engineer Ernest Wilson and C. J. Evans (1897)[6][7] and 
     a prototype that inventor Nikola Tesla demonstrated in New York in 1898.[8] In 1903 Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo 
     introduced a radio based control system called the "Telekino" at the Paris Academy of Sciences,[9] which he hoped to use
      to control a dirigible airship of his own design. Unlike previous “on/off” techniques, the Telekino was able to execute 
      a finite but not limited set of different mechanical actions using a single communication channel.[10][11] From 1904 to 1906 
      Torres chose to conduct Telekino testings in the form of a three-wheeled land vehicle with an effective range of 20 to 30 meters,
       and guiding a manned electrically powered boat, which demonstrated a standoff range of 2 kilometers.[12] The first remote-controlled
        model airplane flew in 1932,[citation needed] and the use of remote control technology for military purposes was worked on intensively 
        during the Second World War, one result of this being the German Wasserfall missile.</pre></p>
